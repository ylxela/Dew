## Inspiration
As devices become more and more prevalent, students are spending more time staring at their devices, and forgetting to properly hydrate. [Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36196695/) have shown that over 40% of students are underhydrated, and as hydration levels decreased, students were more likely to suffer from tiredness, headaches and obesity. 

Since students struggle with self-care, Dew encourages the user to take care of Dewey the Hydration Hamster, whose needs are carefully configured to the user in order to improve their overall health, and achieve their weight loss goals.
