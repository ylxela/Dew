## Inspiration
As more and more resources become available online, the amount of time students spend on their devices increases drastically. Since 1995, obesity rates in Australia have risen by over 10%, and although individuals are quick to try out new diets or workout regimens, the problem of underhydration seldom takes the blame.

 [Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36196695/) have shown that over 40% of students are underhydrated, and hydration levels decreased, participants were more likely to suffer from tiredness, headaches and obesity, all common problems among students.

Since students often struggle with self-care, Dew encourages the user to take care of Dewey the Hydration Hamster, whose needs are carefully configured to the user in order to improve their overall health, and achieve their weight loss goals.
